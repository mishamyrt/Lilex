Lilex is the modern programming font containing a set of ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations.

This is just a font rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible. This helps to read and understand code faster. For some frequent sequences like .. or //, ligatures allow us to correct spacing like kerning pairs.

Compiled versions are available under [releases](https://github.com/mishamyrt/Lilex/releases).
